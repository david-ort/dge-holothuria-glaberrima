# Differential Gene Expression in Holothuria glaberrima using Salmon & edgeR description:

Working under the supervision of Prof. Humberto Ortiz Zuazaga, I set out to find DGE analysis on a sea cucumber species; Holothuria glaberrima. Results include: day 2 (injured regenerating) group has a higher number of expressed genes against the uninjured normalized group than the day 12 and 20 groups.

+ step 1 : trimming and normalizing of the 12 files.
+ step 2 : single ended assembly of the 12 files using Trinity to create a reference transcript.
+ step 3 : indexing and quantifying using Salmon.
+ step 4 : create an MDS, 3 MA plots, and 3 volcano plots for DGE analysis using edgeR.
